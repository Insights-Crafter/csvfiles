I’ve worked on projects in data analysis machine learning and web development and I am eager to solve real-world problems with my skills and learn more.”," I am a student currently studying software engineering, I want to seek a job. I have not developed any skills yet. "
Why do you want to work at our company?,Because your company is known for innovation in AI and I would like to apply my skills while learning from industry experts.,Because I have completed my education and now I have to find a job. Also your company was referred to me 
What are your strengths and weaknesses?,My strength is problem-solving under pressure and my weakness is public speaking but I’m working on improving it through practice,I do not think I  have weaknesses. My strength is I can do everything.
Describe a project you worked on and your role,I built a chatbot with a team of 3. My role was to work on NLP with a Python backend my work helped in improving the system’s accuracy by 15%,I have not participated in any project yet. I am a fresh graduate so I have not learnt anything.
How do you handle tight deadlines or pressure?,I break tasks into smaller parts prioritize and communicate with my clearly with my team to stay on track. Also I take help of my seniors whenever I am stuck. I learn from them,I try to get my work completed by using AI tools to meet the deadlines
Tell me about a time you faced a conflict in a team. How did you resolve it?,During a project two teammates disagreed on design. I suggested combining both ideas and tested them. This reduced conflict and improved the outcome,I leave the conflicts for seniors to solve.
Where do you see yourself in five years?,I see myself as a skilled software engineer leading projects continuously improving my technical and leadership abilities,"I do not know, maybe get a higher position or maybe somewhere abroad."
Why should we hire you over other candidates?,I bring strong skills in software engineering and can learn quickly which means I can adapt and contribute immediately.,Because I really need this job more than others
How do you prioritize tasks when multiple deadlines overlap?,I list tasks which are urgent and of high importance I focus on high-priority work first and communicate with my manager if timelines clash,I just focus on the most important task and leave the other tasks even if the deadlines approach. Because doing the most important task take priority
Do you prefer working independently or as part of a team? Why?,I enjoy both. I like working independently on coding tasks but also value team collaboration for brainstorming and problem-solving and guidance.,I prefer working alone. In teams conflicts happen so I avoid teams to avoid disagreements .
Tell me about a mistake you made in a project and how you fixed it.,I once trained the wrong machine learning model but I quickly researched the correct algorithm and optimization techniques and fixed it before deployment,"I have not worked on any project yet, so I will see later on how to fix issues when I get a job "
How do you keep yourself updated with new technologies?,I follow blogs take online courses and experiment with new frameworks in small projects and also build solo projects for trial and error,I do not really follow new tech. I just learn when I am told to.
Describe a time you took initiative in a project.,In one project I noticed our documentation was weak. I myself notified the project leader and suggested fixes for it which improved team collaboration and enhanced project clarity.,I do not usually take initiative because I have less experience
How do you handle feedback or criticism from a manager or teammate?,I listen carefully ask clarifying questions and apply the feedback to improve my work.,I do not like criticism as I find it annoying
Tell me about a situation where you had to learn a new skill quickly,"For a project at university I had to learn web development in a week. I watched tutorials, built a small prototype, and applied it successfully in our final project",Never tried to learn under pressure. I did not get much oppurtunities to learn when in pressure
What is the difference between Python lists and NumPy arrays?,"Python lists can hold mixed data types and are flexible, but NumPy arrays are optimized for numerical operations, offering better performance and advanced features like broadcasting",They are basically the same thing 
Can you explain the concept of inheritance in object oriented programming?,"Inheritance allows one class to use fields and methods of another class, promoting code reuse and hierarchy for example a dog class inheriting from Animal",Inheritance is copying the data from class to another
Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.,"Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, like predicting house prices. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, like clustering customers based on purchasing behavior.",Supervised learning is supported by results unsupervised is without results given to model
What are REST APIs and why are they important in web development?,"REST APIs allow systems to communicate via HTTP. They are stateless and follow standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, making integration easier",REST APIs serve data to web and mobile apps.
What is the difference between relational and non-relational databases?,"Relational databases like MySQL use structured tables and SQL. Non-relational databases like MongoDB are schema-less and store flexible data, making them good for unstructured data",One is old and one is new. Non-relational is better for everything
How do you handle missing data in a dataset?,"I will analyze the missing pattern, then either drop rows/columns, fill values with mean/median, or use advanced imputation methods depending on the context",I will drop the row which have missing data so that my dataset is clean.
What’s the difference between compilation and interpretation?,Compilation translates code into machine language before execution like in C++. Interpretation executes line by line at runtime such as in python,"Compilation is for old languages, interpretation is for new languages. Compilation gives errors at the end and interpretation gives error earlier"
Can you explain overfitting in machine learning?,"Overfitting happens when a model learns noise in the training data, performing well on training but poorly on unseen data. Regularization, pruning, or more data can help prevent it",It means the model fits perfectly. That’s a good thing.
What is an API?,"An API allows two systems to communicate through defined endpoints, e.g., weather app fetching data.",It is just a website which displays data
Difference between classification and regression?,Classification predicts categories such as spam or not regression predicts continuous values like  house prices,Classification is predicting categories while regression shows a relation
