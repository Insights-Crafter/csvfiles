"59;american woman in bikini desecrates french catacombs for her female indiana jones brand;""why you should become a minimalist why you should become a minimalist february    comments lifestyle 
the most abused word in the english language is need if youre reading this post i contend there is little that you actually need beyond what you currently possess you have ample electricity to power your computer in a climatecontrolled environment with running water and food in your wellstocked refrigerator why then do you always hear people talking about how they need more stuff 
humans have a deeplyrooted drive to compete with each other and advertisers capitalize on this impulse take a moment to picture the average person that you meet what do they have to take pride in buying the newest thing allows them to join the club of consumers and for a fleeting moment to be measured on an equal playing field despite their personal shortcomings the internal pain of their lifes problems dissipates for the split second they can boast superiority over everyone who doesnt have the same shiny widget 
this conspicuous consumption creates a selffulfilling egoinvestment in the broken system although borrowing money for useless luxury purchases subjugates people into debt slavery the mentality is if i paid  for this hunk of metal and im working overtime to pay it off it must be worth it  and so are other things that the commercials are telling me to buy quite literally we are working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we dont need  
if youre reading this blog you are likely a male aged  who wants to do one or more of the following quit your job travel explore a locationindependent income get yourself in shape take charge of a relationship and learn valuable life skills a minimalist mentality helps you do all of these things 
having fewer possessions forces you to properly place a higher value on experiences this will make it safer and more fulfilling to travel because you are in touch with what truly makes you happy if youre working on a side hustle or starting a business the desire for needless possessions drains your disposable income levels and prevents you from taking risks if my business fails will i have to give up my car lease preempt this loss aversion by having less to lose 
if you want to move to a better city with a higher cost of living having excess stuff sets a floor on how much rent youll pay to house your crap and in turn how much you can spend on leisure activities if youre a distractable person like me removing visual noise from your area makes you more likely to create things with your mind and less likely to fixate on your environment  
throwing or giving useless things away is a good first step since possessions have a psychic weight that you may not realize until you rid yourself of them to fully embrace this mindset you must also kill the desires that have been inculcated in you since birth cut down on your consumer impressions by watching less tv and trying to rationally dissect the techniques used in the few advertisements you encounter find fulfillment in hobbies and work rather than chasing the rush and eventual hedonic adaptation from consuming much like a drug successive bouts of consumerism create a higher baseline where your overall happiness is no different but you end up having a bunch of useless crap that ties you down 
girls can also be troublesome in this endeavor ever notice that when a girl spends extended time in your living space she beings to tell you that you need a new this or a replacement that a good friend once told me all human beings have an innate desire to create  most women cant so they redecorate limit your exposure to women who attempt to thwart a separation from consumerism ironically men likely to lead a minimalistnomadic lifestyle are simply more attractive to primesmv women think about whether the starving artist or the bottle service guy throwing money around ends up getting more ass as always watch how women behave rather than listening to what they say when they are protesting your lifestyle change 
ask yourself this if your house burned down and you had nothing but the clothes on your back what would you be worth to society and to yourself how would you feel about losing all of the possessions you own most people plugged into the matrix would rather die than think about replacing aunt gladyss vase or baby pictures they havent looked at in a decade this is an illusion once you begin to divorce yourself from this emotional investment to stuff you will implicitly place more value on your skills and past experiences 
minimalism is not a synonym for frugality or cheapness i dont wear a potato sack while pedaling a used tricycle to work every day  i simply choose to allocate my money to experiences and a few possessions that will fulfill me and advance my lifes purpose rather than enslave myself into debt for trinkets that will collect dust somewhere 
taking the red pill is about learning to separate your priorities and desires from those that society forces upon you i dont promise that adopting this mindset will make everybody happy but it will certainly help to clarify what contributes to your individual sense of self and will allow you to focus on the internal and external traits that exemplify a man of value"";1"

press tv 
democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton leads her republican rival by three percentage points nationally as they head into the final day of a tight race for the white house according to a new poll 
the final bloomberg politicsselzer  co poll released on monday has clinton ahead of trump  percent to  percent 
libertarian candidate gary johnson was at  percent and green party candidate jill stein had  percent support 
clinton also leads trump by three points in a hypothetical twoway matchup when thirdparty candidates are not included 
another tracking poll released early on monday also put clinton in the lead 
the former secretary of state held a fourpoint lead over the billionaire businessman in the latest abc newswashington post poll the survey showed  percent of likely us voters backed clinton while  percent said they supported trump 
the clinton campaign received a late break with fbi director james comey announcing sunday that no criminal charges were forthcoming in the probe of clintons newlyfound emails 
based on our review we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july the fbi chief wrote in a new letter to congressional committee chairmen 
the development is a major relief to clinton who is spending the final hours of her campaign trying to close trumps path to presidency donald trump walks off the stage after holding a rally at loudoun fairgrounds in leesburg virginia early in the morning on november   photo by afp 
comey sent the presidential race into a frenzy last month when he sent a letter to congress saying the fbi had discovered emails in a separate probe that could be linked to the investigation into clintons use of a private server when she was secretary of state 
the surprise move infuriated democrats and lifted the presidential hopes of trump who has turned the email controversy into a favorite line of attack against clinton 
still trump continued to seize on the email issue insisting that clinton is guilty 
hillary clinton is guilty she knows it the fbi knows it the people know he said sunday at a rally in detroit michigan and now its up to the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box on november  
both clinton and trump plan to spend the last day of the campaign racing across key battleground states that could determine the results of tuesdays election 
trump will visit florida north carolina pennsylvania and new hampshire and finish the day with a rally in grand rapids michigan 
clinton is travelling to pennsylvania and michigan before closing with a midnightrally in raleigh north carolina"";0"

antitrump street protests linked to the soros funded organization moveonorg have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the  presidential election result 
mainstream media outlets like cnn and msnbc have given the protests aroundtheclock media coverage drowning out all other news stories including a successful transition meeting between the president elect and president barack obama 
outsider vs insider manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of trump presidency photo illustration wires shawn helton 
the free thought project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated antitrump protests organized in part by by the george soros ngo moveon 
washington dc  billionaire globalist financier george soros moveonorg has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of donald trump  exposing the protests to largely be an organized topdown operation  and not an organic movement of concerned americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media 
wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least  major us cities chicago new york los angeles philadelphia boston washington dc portland ore st paul minn seattle  and several other cities saw protests according to usa today 
in light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of trump a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether its an organic grassroots movement or something much more organized sophisticated and potentially dangerous 
soros affiliated organization moveonorg released the following press release yesterday afternoon 
americans to come together in hundreds peaceful gatherings of solidarity resistance and resolve following election results 
hundreds of americans dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the white house and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny racism islamophobia and xenophobia 
tonight thousands of americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation including outside the white house following the results of tuesdays presidential election 
the gatherings  organized by moveonorg and allies  will affirm a continued rejection of donald trumps bigotry xenophobia islamophobia and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the america we still believe is possible 
within two hours of the calltoaction moveon members had created more than  gatherings nationwide with the number continuing to grow on wednesday afternoon 
soros agitprop empire 
last year during the ongoing european migrant crisis startling claims were levied by hungarian pm victor orban left photo concerning the role played by soros 
pm orban contended that the founder and chair of open society foundations open society institute was entrenched in a  circle of activists that inadvertently become part of this international humansmuggling network 
the stunning declaration by orban recalled the misguided machinations of the occupy movement  aka ows in  as well as the soros funded protests in ferguson missouri in  along with other black lives matter protests this past year  all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants along with paid provocateurs into violent action and social unrest 
back in january moveon publicly endorsed the bernie sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for blm associated groups seen backing sanders its worth mentioning that moveon also supported the obama campaign in  and according to the website sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement 
as we said back in march professional political agitator flash mobs had been mobilized at future trump campaign events making it very difficult to run a normal campaign  as activists attempted to take away trumps strength in numbers at his rallies this was confirmed at events in both ohio and at a trump primary campaign event the university of illinois chicago earlier this year where hundreds of blm activists and sanders supporters triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage  shortly after trump started speaking then again at reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort trump away 
in a politico article in early  entitled  major donors consider funding black lives matter  we gained deeper insight into the political funding for blm and the soros linked democratic alliance 
major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression said steve phillips a democracy alliance member and significant contributor to democratic candidates and causes he donated to a st louis nonprofit group called the organization for black struggle that helped organize  black lives matterrelated protests in ferguson missouri over the police killing of a black teenager named michael brown and phillips and his wife democracy alliance board member susan sandler are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement 
it worth noting how soros a long time contributor to hillary clinton donated  million in pac money in  and january of  soros reportedly gave  million to boost clintons campaign  soros also recently funded  million to latino groups looking to stop trumps rise towards a potential gop nomination and beyond 
look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country  as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances 
social engineering political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media ngos and social media image source abc news  
during the last month it was revealed how investigative nonprofit project veritas found evidence that the dnc paid participants to incite violence at trump rallies during the course of the  election 
if those reports are accurate  reports which have gone unchallenged so far  this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also us criminal law 
paid protest social justice warriors incite antitrump violence across the us image source youtube  
usa color revolutions 
both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare these political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions ultimately a radical globalist and cultural marxist progressive agenda is at play  eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial color upheavals and where possible  weakening a countrys national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the un or imf while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the publics political perspective 
this is how the us and its cia conduct their destablization color revolution campaigns overseas  and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the us 
overseas washington tends to use the same cast of ngo fronts to buildup prous political opposition groups as well as plan and generate civil unrest they include the albert einstein institute aei national endowment for democracy ned international republican institute iri national democratic institute ndi freedom house and later the international center for nonviolent conflict icnc and the us agency for international development usaid the financial and contractor arm of the department of state 
inside the us deep state actors in washington generally work through democratic party affiliated organizations like moveonorg  as well as through labor union organizations like aflcio  and unite here  these along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests 
it still remains to be seen if trumps stated dynamic political vision for america can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world in addition to helping economic woes at home or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism this remains to be seen 
certainly judging by president obama and hillary clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots the political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new trump presidency 
but one thing is for sure  theres no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the th president and the public should question why 
legal action against soros groups 
in a recent report featured at rt news we learn that george soros and blm activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in dallas and baton rouge the father of the dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a black lives matter protest is suing the organizations activists and george soros for  million  in a separate suit a baton rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a blm protest 
the father of patrick zamarripa filed a lawsuit against black lives matter and other groups for allegedly inciting a war on police that led to the death of his son 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in dallas on monday seeks  million in damages 
while defendant black lives matter claims to combat antiblack racism the lawsuit said according to the fort worth star telegram the movement has in fact incited and committed further violence severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities jews and caucasians defendant black lives matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang 
the misguided machinations behind the antitrump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the presidentelect will these protest groups be a reboot of the ows movement occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into  and beyond

now it looks like soros may be setting his sights on sabotaging the forthcoming trump presidency 
we do know thanks to wikileaks that george soros was a huge supporter of hillary clinton as hillary clinton was always looking out of george soros best interests

"228;defense board white house blocked navy from s china sea warship passages;""liberty blitzkrieg october   
the name peter kadzik probably doesnt ring a bell for many of you although it probably should this guy is a real piece of work as an excellent article published earlier today at the daily caller demonstrates 
heres some of what we learned 
the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta the democrats campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik a top official at the justice department 
the dinner arrangement revealed in hacked podesta emails released by wikileaks is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices 
podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 
the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server says matthew whitaker the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust a government watchdog group 
kadzik who started at the doj in  helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 
kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 
in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign 
podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 
podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation but he defended the falsehoods saying later that he was merely relaying false information from clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time 
he did lie to me podesta said about clinton in a national public radio interview in  clinton was acquitted by the senate in feb  of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe 
kadzik then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin  oshinsky represented podesta through the fiasco 
podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 
kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon 
to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   
a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 
the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 
on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library 
the first mention of personal contact between podesta and kadzik in the wikileaks dump is in an oct   email sent out by vincent roberti a lobbyist who is close to podesta and his superlobbyist brother tony podesta in it roberti refers to a dinner reservation at posto a washington dc restaurant 
the dinner was set for  that evening just a day after clinton gave  hours of testimony to the benghazi committee 
podesta and kadzik met several months later for dinner at podestas home another email shows  and in an email sent on may   kadziks son asked podesta for a job on the clinton campaign 
ill have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction 
as head of the office of legislative affairs kadzik handles inquiries from congress on a variety of issues in that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the clinton investigation 
the justice department and fbi have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation which concluded in july with no charges filed against clinton 
but kadzik worked on other clinton email issues in his dealings with congress 
last november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation 
seems like a pretty important decision for a clinton crony to make 
the justice department declined to comment on the record for this article 
could the department of injustice have any less credibility

"243;obama should just pardon hillary for every conceivable crime;""posted by madeline  oct      daily blog    thanks heru by lisa brown  i find it interesting to experienceobserve i can see their desire to exposehonor their hearts yet their confusion at losing their masculine persona if they do i can see their beauty magnificence and purity of their soul and their not knowing how to be a man and feel all this stuff emerging within them i can also see them put stronger walls up trying their best to hold on to old realities not true anymore fear of feeling hurt failure and losing control letting anyone in being let down abandoned judged which do not occur on new earth 
it is no different than when we woke up women and feminine energy men yet it is for theyve lived this life of strength of being powerful of being strong and surviving everything for the really really masculine energy man or women but we are talking about men right now their softness brings forth fear of vulnerability which is so totally the opposite for we must allow ourselves that rawnessthat vulnerability in order to truly feel again to bring the walls of protection down to not live in the fear of being alone 
when our soul awakens we desire connection deeply yet we seek it in others first experience after experience activates our unworthiness feeling of notgoodenough lack of intimate lasting connection rejected for not being enough in others minds where they are not intune with their own sacred soul 
we are in the vibrations of the very masculine man awakening now more and more its important to support them show them that they can be masculine and honor their soul at the same time its important to open up and share to show them its safe to be seen its important to not impose not pressure not push just hold the space for them to open up on their own and not feel threatened as they do its important for the women to support the men now yet in very different ways than before 
those who have opened their hearts know that our relationships are very different here we do not hold attachments cords expectations or needs anymore all new earth relationships are powerful beautiful freeing supportive empowering inspiring and a cocreative experience of inservice to ourselves each other and all on earth they are to usher in the new era this one now through unity peace respect support contribution and divine love 
many men have been trying to wake up going through their distortions shedding old human needs and exchanging them for new desires to take their place in this new world now the more human masculine energy the more safety protection and survival mechanisms there were judgment is huge and its scary when your whole world starts to change for you and you dont have a choice anymore 
women its your time to stepup to be the one that already understands to be the one who holds that space and the stability in place when the old starts to collapse crumble dissolve when emotions start to surface that you didnt know were there when nothing makes sense and you dont understand why you cant keep it together anymore and be the one that everyone could depend on physically we all know what this is like weve been there 
weve been through the collapse to move into creation of the new to rebirth ourselves our own realities and now the men do this too there are many who were not ready before yet those times vibrations are gone you will start to see more men awaken especially the strong ones and the fear of how to deal with this part of your job as an ascended being as a master being as a light tower and a keeper of new earth is to not just hold the space but show them how its all not only going to be okay its going to be awesome 
it doesnt matter what body we are in female or male men now identify with their masculine bodies as an expectation that they are supposed to be the strong one the providers the ones that dont break when we know better 
when the soul awakens the human aspect does breakdissolve and it doesnt matter what bodies we are in this process is genderless we all have human masculine human feminine and we have divine masculine and divine feminine too 
relationships built or formed out of unconsciousness collapse end reshape or transform often all of these some go their separate ways while each evolves awakens diesrebirthsgrows up as spiritsoul in physical body form 
many womenspartnersfriends roles will be to support others and super masculine man now ready to open up just because they struggled before resisted before doesnt mean they still arewill when you show them wayshower that you can handle it you can be the support you can even be the provider if need be then they can honor themselves without the weight of everyone depending on them to do it all by themselves anymore 
as masculinefeminine are redefined according to energy and that each can fill all of these roles themselves then the balance can shift easily and each as they honor themselves and step up into their own roles can support others ready to do this too 
financial support is also a part of this which can be emasculating if viewed through human eyes when one realizes that money is just energy to support us all they let go of the misperceptions and definitions once held by who did what role in the old paradigm money was associated with power which was a masculine thing now money is an expression of gratitude love respect contribution and is to support those stepping intofulfilling their souls purposes and roles here when the focus is taken off of money and put on what is truly important the soul then each can flourish each can receive each can share each contributes the energy of what is important to create a whole new reality of unified existence here 
strength is through the purely open true warrior heart power is the knowledge and wisdom that comes through your own connection as pure source light within abundance is an existence divine sacred love is what makes the difference here union is when souls come together to work together to be together and to bring forth realities consciously together we all have tohad to do this ourselves so that we could createanchorhold the foundation of a whole newremembered existence here 
your soul can see the awakening soul of another you can expand the space or shut it downclose portals whats appropriate will be determined by how conscious present and open each is as a master you have the capability to see understand and do more than you did as a limited and lacking human your energy makes the difference they are going to need to pull away be alone sleep and have someone to talk to without being judged the human aspect doesnt believe its safe to open up without being attacked judged or imposed upon its up to you to show that it is masculine energy believes it when they see it you prove it by being your higher self all of the time their soul will emerge as you do 
higher consciousness existence i love you

"261;competing theories on why the fbi reopened the hillary email server investigation;""eight ways to strengthen our democracy beyond voting the strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections by chuck collins   chuck collins 
throughout this trying election season weve been told how much is at stake with our vote but the success of any democracy depends on continuing to pay attention long after we cast our ballots 
so lets pledge to strengthen our democracy with a few resolutions to focus our intentions and keep us moving forward over the next four years 
 change your media diet  
way too much ink airtime and mental real estate has been consumed by the horserace reporting on electionsits all about whos winning and losing so unplug from the talk shows that interview pollsters and engage in partisan bickering all day find the commentators and independent media outlets that strengthen our civic life 
 turn off corporate media 
this election has been very profitable for big media corporations but bad for our democracy as cbs chairman les moonves remarked  man who would have expected the ride were all having right now the moneys rolling in and this is fun 
our differences have been compounded by media reports that amplify the loudest and most partisan utterances election coverage this year has encouraged us to view one another as cartoon caricatures not neighbors 
 reject the consumer mentality in elections  
were encouraged to view national elections like consumers buying a car but presidential elections can make most of us feel like spectators not participants election day is a small part of our real democracythink of voting as a tiny fraction of your civic life 
 make your voice heard  
pledge to communicate with your elected officials all year round not just when they want your vote call write email and attend community forums when a politician hears from a dozen constituents with the same concern it matters 
a few resolutions must address our polarized political atmosphere the only way to break through this is by connecting with people we dont always agree with 
for instance the liberal california sociologist arlie hochschild spent five years interviewing conservative tea party activists in louisiana making friends and asking deep questions she urges us all to scale the empathy wall and learn each others stories 
heres a few easy ways to get started 
try a social media fast 
social media is amazing but it mostly serves as an echo chamber to reinforce our existing views its not a substitute for talking to people asking questions and learning why people support certain policies 
 practice the art of civil discourse  
find ways to meet others facetoface to engage in conversations not soapbox speeches and debates look at the  living room conversation  movement that brings people together across political divisions their goal is to encourage authentic respectful conversations to strengthen relationships and advance understanding of the challenges opportunities and solutions before us 
finally other resolutions should focus on changing our polarizing election system 
 eliminate the wealth primary  
long before voters cast their ballots in a primary big money donors have winnowed the field and selected who will stand for election people all across the political spectrum agree that we need fundamental campaign finance reform to reduce the influence of big money including the repeal of citizens united  
 break the twoparty duopoly  
a growing number of voters have declared independence from the two major parties so why do we allow other voices and perspectives to be excluded from presidential debates our democracy would benefit if we had real choices outside the two major parties as they do in most other countries in the world 
the strength of our civic life depends on what we do outside elections and especially after the deeply toxic experience of  we all need to step up to protect our real democracy from those who profit from division

iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif says comprehensive international determination is necessary to fight and uproot terrorism in the middle east 
the iranian foreign minister made the remarks at the end of a threeway meeting among him and his russian and syrian counterparts sergei lavrov and walid almuallem respectively in moscow on friday on the latest situation in syria 
zarif said tehran moscow and damascus should reinforce their cooperation in the campaign against terrorism 
he stressed the importance of adopting strategies to stop the delivery of weapons and military equipment to the foreignbacked takfiri militants wreaking havoc in syria 
the political settlement of the crisis in syria will be possible through negotiations between the sides in order to put an end to this crisis zarif said 
the three foreign ministers agreed to intensify the fight against terrorism and said their countries have a common stance on the antiterror campaign in the region particularly in syria 
lavrov said iran russia and syria have determined necessary frameworks for fighting terrorism and expressed their readiness to take measures that will play a key role in the campaign against the malicious phenomenon 
the russian foreign minister added that the moscow meeting highlighted the significance of a firm and efficient battle against terrorism in the middle east particularly in syria 
he said the meetings participants also discussed ways to send humanitarian aid to civilians in syria and stop the flow of weapons into the hands of terrorists operating in the warhit country 
muallem for his part said the us is making no effort to find a political solution to the syrian crisis 
the syrian foreign minister added that a recent agreement between washington and moscow signed in the swiss city of geneva in september failed to bear any fruit 
after marathon talks in geneva us secretary of state john kerry and his russian counterpart reached an agreement on september  to impose a ceasefire in the syrian city of aleppo and to coordinate military operations against terrorist groups in the country 
aleppo syrias second largest city remains divided between government forces in the west and foreignbacked terrorists in the east making it a frontline battleground 
russia which has been conducting an aerial military campaign against extremist militants in syria has repeatedly voiced its readiness for a ceasefire russia has been insisting however that any such lull in fighting should be accompanied with a meticulous separation of terrorists from less extremist militants fighting against the syrian government 
the syrian foreign minister said washington is not interested in solving the crisis in damascus and takes measures only to serve the its own interests and those of its regional allies 
since march  syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some western states and their regional allies backed by the russian air cover the syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of daesh and other terrorist groups 
the socalled syrian observatory for human rights and united nations special envoy for syria staffan de mistura have put the death toll from the syria conflict at more than  and  respectively 
this is while the un has stopped its official casualty count in syria citing its inability to verify the figures it receives from various sources 
over the past few weeks the syrian forces have wrested control of several areas across the wartorn country as they press ahead with their counterterrorism operations 
iran russia share strong antiterror stance zarif 
meanwhile in a meeting with his russian counterpart earlier on friday the iranian foreign minister said tehran and moscow have tough stances in the fight against terrorism in the region through common strategies 
tehran and moscow have broad cooperation on regional issues such as the campaign against terrorism and extremism and we share views on these matters zarif added russian foreign minister sergei lavrov r speaks with his iranian counterpart mohammad javad zarif during a meeting in moscow russia on october   photo by reuters 
he also noted that iran and russia have succeeded in making considerable progress in all fields including in economic and political sectors as well as regional and international developments 
i am pleased that in recent years relations between the islamic republic of iran and the russian federation as two good neighbors and two key players have made many positive developments zarif said 
lavrov for his part said tehran and moscow urged cooperation on an unrelenting approach to terrorists operating against the syrian government 
iran and russia have similar stances on the ongoing deadly crisis in syria moscow and tehran reject any foreign interference in the affairs of the warhit country stressing that only the syrians are entitled to decide their own fate

document préparatoire de la présidence russe réseau voltaire  new york étatsunis   octobre  english español ??????? ???? ?? coopération entre lorganisation des nations unies et les organisations régionales et sousrégionales aux fins du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales  organisation du traité de sécurité collective organisation de shanghai pour la coopération et communauté détats indépendants la fédération de russie compte organiser le  octobre  un débat sur le thème  coopération entre lorganisation des nations unies et les organisations régionales et sousrégionales aux fins du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales  organisation du traité de sécurité collective organisation de shanghai pour la coopération et communauté détats indépendants  qui constituera un évènement phare de sa présidence au conseil de sécurité
au vu de la dimension mondiale des problèmes et menaces actuels et de la nécessité délaborer des stratégies collectives pour les combattre efficacement il est essentiel de renforcer la coopération entre lonu et les organisations régionales et sousrégionales dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité
pour ce qui est de lonu il sagit avant tout de tirer parti de son caractère universel aussi bien au niveau de ses membres que de ses activités ainsi que de sa légitimité mondialement reconnue les organisations régionales quant à elles connaissent souvent mieux la situation dans les régions relevant de leur compétence et dans de nombreux cas sont dotées de mécanismes de prévention et de maintien de la paix adaptés aux réalités locales il importe à cet égard que les activités des organisations régionales tendent à trouver des solutions pacifiques et politiques aux conflits émergents
dans ce contexte il est particulièrement important que lonu et ses principaux partenaires régionaux se coordonnent régulièrement sur les questions ayant trait au maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales ainsi le conseil de sécurité tient régulièrement des séances sur la coopération avec lunion africaine lorganisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en europe et lunion européenne ces dernières années un examen a également été mené sur la coopération avec la ligue des états arabes lassociation des nations de lasie du sudest lunion des nations de lamérique du sud et dautres organisations régionales
comme on le sait la collaboration entre lonu et ses partenaires régionaux couvre un nombre toujours plus grand de questions aux activités de maintien et de consolidation de la paix sont venues sajouter la lutte contre la prolifération des armes de destruction massive et le trafic darmes légères et de petit calibre ainsi que la lutte contre le cyberterrorisme et la migration illégale domaines dans lesquels la coopération entre les organisations concernées et lonu est de plus en plus étroite cette coopération joue un rôle essentiel dans le maintien de la paix et de la stabilité à léchelle de leurasie et plus particulièrement en asie centrale
cest précisément dans ce domaine quuvrent trois organisations relativement jeunes dans une vaste zone sétendant de leurope orientale à lextrêmeorient à savoir lorganisation du traité de sécurité collective otsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération et la communauté détats indépendants cei de plus en plus influentes sur la scène politique mondiale ces organisations contribuent considérablement au renforcement de la sécurité régionale et internationale
le débat sera axé sur le rôle de ces trois organisations dans la lutte contre les menaces qui pèsent sur la paix et la sécurité dans la région notamment le terrorisme le trafic de drogues et la criminalité organisée il permettra également à ces organisations de réaffirmer leur volonté de renforcer la coopération sur le plan pratique avec lonu notamment avec son centre régional pour la diplomatie préventive en asie centrale
lotsc est une structure pluridimensionnelle à même de réagir résolument aux divers problèmes et menaces actuels auxquels peuvent faire face ses états membres à cet égard le resserrement de la coopération entre lonu est lotsc dans le domaine du maintien de la paix est prometteur lotsc déploie dimportants efforts pour renforcer ses propres capacités de maintien de la paix qui pourront aussi être mises à la disposition des opérations de maintien de la paix des nations unies elle contribue activement en outre aux actions menées sur le plan international pour reconstruire lafghanistan après le conflit et pour écarter la menace que représentent les stupéfiants provenant de ce pays
ses relations avec lonu se révèlent fructueuses dans de nombreux domaines comme la lutte contre le terrorisme et le trafic de drogues le maintien de la paix ou la lutte contre la criminalité organisée lotsc entretient et développe des rapports productifs avec les entités spécialisées de lonu notamment le comité contre le terrorisme du conseil de sécurité et loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime
tous les deux ans lassemblée générale adopte une résolution sur la coopération entre lonu et lotsc et il est prévu quelle en adopte une à sa soixante et onzième session au titre du point de lordre du jour intitulé  coopération entre lorganisation des nations unies et les organisations régionales ou autres 
les fondements juridiques de la coopération entre lonu et lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies ont été posés à la suite de la signature en  de la déclaration conjointe sur la coopération entre les secrétariats des deux organisations actuellement lorganisation de shanghai et lonu collaborent étroitement dans des domaines tels que la prévention et le règlement des conflits la lutte contre le terrorisme linstance régionale de lutte contre le terrorisme relevant de lorganisation de shanghai uvre à cette fin la nonprolifération des armes de destruction massive la lutte contre la criminalité transnationale et le trafic de drogues et la sécurité informatique internationale
dans ce contexte lorganisation de shanghai appuie activement les efforts déployés par la communauté internationale et les organismes des nations unies pour rétablir la paix en afghanistan se prononçant toujours en faveur du maintien du rôle central de coordination de lonu dans le règlement du conflit afghan
quant à la cei la sécurité et la lutte contre les menaces actuelles ont toujours été et demeurent un des domaines prioritaires de coopération entre ses états membres
une coopération constructive avec les organisations internationales est également essentielle pour contrer les menaces émergentes les pays de la cei sont parties à tous les principaux instruments internationaux régissant la coopération dans les domaines de la sécurité du désarmement et de la lutte contre les menaces actuelles et contribuent efficacement à leur mise en uvre
des mesures conjointes sont prises compte tenu du rôle moteur de lonu et de la nécessité détablir des partenariats constructifs avec dautres institutions internationales et leurs entités spécialisées comme le comité contre le terrorisme loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime lorganisation internationale de police criminelle interpol lorganisation internationale pour les migrations le hautcommissariat des nations unies pour les réfugiés et le groupe daction financière sur le blanchiment des capitaux
lélargissement et le renforcement de la coopération entre lonu et lotsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération et la cei au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies semble contribuer de manière constructive à la réalisation des objectifs de lonu y compris à lélimination des menaces et problèmes actuels dune part ces organisations régionales doivent activement envisager de mettre leurs capacités au service de lonu et dautre part lonu doit continuer daccorder lattention voulue au renforcement de la coordination et de la coopération avec ces organisations dans le strict respect de ses propres prérogatives et de celles de son conseil de sécurité
dans ce contexte nous invitons les états membres de lonu à exposer leurs idées sur les moyens de renforcer la sécurité dans la région eurasienne avec laide des mécanismes régionaux existants force est de constater que la stabilité de cette vaste région est une condition sine qua non de la croissance économique et de lédification de létat des pays de leurasie et nous serions par conséquent reconnaissants aux délégations de nous faire part de leurs vues notamment en ce qui concerne les liens entre sécurité et développement nous sommes convaincus quici dans le cadre de lonu qui jouit dune légitimité universelle nous serons tous ensemble en mesure de proposer des stratégies novatrices visant la stabilisation des régions vulnérables susceptibles par la suite dêtre mises en uvre dans dautres régions du monde qui sont au centre des préoccupations du conseil de sécurité
le secrétaire général de lonu ban kimoon le secrétaire général de lotsc nikolaï bordiouja le secrétaire général de lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération rachid alimov et le viceprésident du comité exécutif de la cei serguei ivanov feront un exposé lors du débat les états membres des organisations régionales susmentionnées et les représentants dautres états intéressés sont invités à participer à la réunion"";0"

"441;ers fans care more about victories than kaepernick;""dutch antiislam mp wilders to snub hate speech trial afp october   
defiant dutch antiislam politician geert wilders said friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for  elections 
the trial opens on monday before a threejudge bench with the farright politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about moroccans living in the netherlands 
it is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country wilders said in a statement friday dubbing the case a political trial in which i refuse to cooperate 
it comes as opinion polls have shown his farright freedom party pvv doing well ahead of march elections 
after riding high amid the migrant crisis the party is now polling neckandneck with prime minister mark ruttes liberals each predicted to win between  to  seats in the seat parliament 
set to last until november  the trial focuses on a comment made at a march  rally when wilders asked supporters if they wanted fewer or more moroccans in your city and in the netherlands 
when the crowd shouted back fewer fewer wilders answered were going to organise that 
snip 
wilders said friday he would leave his defence in the hands of his lawyer geertjan knoops and instead go to work in the parliament in the hague 
snip 
judges earlier this month dismissed arguments by wilders lawyers that the trial was politically motivated adding they did not believe it will impact the pvvs election campaign 
politicians are granted broad freedoms of expression because of their official position the judges ruled last month 
precisely therefore politicians have an important role to avoid feeding intolerance by making these kind of public statements 
wilders hit back friday saying it is a travesty that i have to stand trial because i spoke about fewer moroccans 
millions of dutch citizens  percent of the population want fewer moroccans he claimed 
not because they despise all moroccans or want all moroccans out of the country but because they are sick and tired of the nuisance and terror caused by so many moroccans

"476;the bundy verdict is another defeat for obama;""obamas un ambassador cuba is right about our human rights october   daniel greenfield 
you may remember ambassador samantha power from the time she proposed invading israel since then shes gone on to a glorious career of representing the castro regime at the un or is it the obama regime it naturally gets confusing when the us ambassador to the un sides with the enemy against her own country 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you 
under obama power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the united states and they say obama is some sort of antiamerican traitor i dont see it if he were we would be seeing signs of it by now 
anyway power then went on to audition for the job of the un ambassador from cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal communist dictatorship about our human rights are wellfounded 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust 
somehow though siding with communist dictatorships who are the enemy while betraying our allies in the region does not create any mistrust only opposing the left does"";1"

the pentagons plan to launch an offensive against the daesh isil terrorist group in syria is only aimed at undermining a successful attempt by the syrian government and its allies to defeat the terror group says james petras an american political commentator 
us defense secretary ashton carter told nbc news on wednesday that the pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust daesh from the syrian city of raqqah the terror groups stronghold in the country 
carter who was in iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of mosul from daesh said the raqqah offensive would begin when iraqs second largest city is cleared 
he claimed that us forces wont be directly involved in any of the operations 
this is a ploy to have the us in northern syria petras said arguing that the us was seeking to undermine international efforts to defeat daesh in a bid to reinforce its own foothold in the conflictridden country 
i dont believe that the attack on raqqah is a positive move because i think it brings the us closer to its policy of establishing a nofly zone in northern syria which will directly affect the efforts of the syrian government and its alliesiran and russiato defend the country 
the analyst noted that raqqah is a problem for the syrian people and damascus should be allowed to choose its allies in the battle 
petras went on to note that carters remarks bear similarities to us democratic presidential candidate hillary clintons plans for a conflagration in the middle east 
the ongoing western efforts in syria have a different nature washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove president bashar alassad from power 
carters claim that us ground forces will have no part in the fight against daesh came at a time when more than  american soldiers were stationed in iraq tasked with providing training and intelligence to iraqi forces loading"";1"

"668;comment on congress attorney general lynch pleads fifth on secret iran ransom payments by marlene;""daisy luther 
according to a report in the new yorker james comey  big kahuna of the fbi went fullon cowboy in releasing details of the new clinton email inquiry apparently the department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election 
gosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was donald trump who was being investigated by the fbi 
comey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  
we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record 
the doj  and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch  who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election 
heres comeys letter to the senate judiciary committee 
really 
the doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi 
thats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something 
this is from the new yorker report emphasis mine 
on friday james comey the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general loretta lynch  sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clintons private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
comeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials comey who is a republican appointee of president obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign 
hillary clinton has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  
oh ill bet she does 
ill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach 
of course when its her things are a little different arent they 
we do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her 
and the fact that we know has severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal 
about a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state  
finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton 
but it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be 
given other considerations  percent say it makes no difference 
meanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now 
why did james comey who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation 
opponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons 
they wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence 
they will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it clinton isnt taking it gracefully 
clintons complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before 
this is from the telegraph  a uk publication 
hillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails 
james comey announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material 
on saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put clinton  percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from  points just  days previously 
but wait  it gets better 
the clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr comey alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive and mrs clinton herself called the decision unprecedented and deeply troubling 
its pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida 
democrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which comes as polls showed mrs clintons lead falling just  days before the presidential election 
this is like an wheeler smacking into us and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time said donna brazile the chairwoman of the democratic national committee 
the campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can 
we dont want it to knock us off our game but on the secondtolast weekend of the race we find ourselves having to tell voters keep your focus keep your eyes on the prize 
hillarys campaign manager sounds pretty desperate to me as for the complaints from hrc they just make her sound like the outoftouch moneygrabbing powerhungry deceitful"";0"

"681;vermont fights the opioid epidemic by limiting prescribed painkillers;""keywords cavities  coconut oil  dental health  gingivitis  oil pulling  teeth 
we all know about the popular and ancient practice of oil pulling but many of us dont understand how this practice works or how exactly it benefits our teeth oil pulling began in ayurvedic medicine thousands of years ago and has achieved widespread popularity in modern society today 
but the question remainsdoes it help your smile and how 
the claims of oil pulling 
lets take a look at each of these popular claims of oil pulling 
it makes your mouth healthier by pulling out bad bacteria that can cause cavities and gum disease oil pulling can actually make your mouth healthier and even stop chronic bad breath 
it whitens teeth research has not proved this but some people claim they get whiter teeth with oil pulling this should be considered a side effect of oil pulling albeit a great one rather than its main purpose 
it heals cavities oil pulling can remove the bacteria and plaque that cause tooth decay but typically oil pulling alone is not enough to heal cavities you need to stop eating so much sugar get more vitamins and minerals such as k d and calcium and switch your toothpaste to help heal cavities with oil pulling 
it cures disease ancient cultures used oil pulling as a way to draw out toxins from the mouth to prevent them from affecting the body research doesnt show whether or not oil pulling can help any type of disease but research does link oral health to body healthso a healthy mouth could help you prevent heart disease  respiratory illnesses and even cognitive decline 
what the research says 
now that weve seen the popular claims of oil pulling lets find out what modern research actually says about this ageold practice 
research shows that oil pulling can actually the stop inflammation bacteria plaque and bad breath associated with gum disease therefore it may be an effective treatment for gum disease combined with a healthy diet and great oral health practices 
it can decrease the likelihood of tooth decay and reduce overall plaque content in the mouth oil pulling can also help prevent tooth loss and oral diseases such as oral cancer periodontal disease and oral thrush oil pulling may be able to reverse tooth decay but only when combined with other healthy practices 
although research hasnt proved that oil pulling helps decrease your chances for developing chronic disease keeping your mouth healthy and free of toxins can benefit your whole body 
the verdict 
if you want to give oil pulling a try do this practice every day put a tablespoon of oil in your mouth preferably sesame or coconut and swish it around for up to twenty minutes as soon as you wake up spit out in the trash then brush and floss your teeth as normal easy 
the verdict is in oil pulling can help you get a beautiful and healthy smile but it should not replace regular brushing and flossing as your oral care routine practice oil pulling first thing in the morning before you eat or brush then enjoy the benefits of a healthy smile without giving up your brushing and flossing habits you might also like"";0"

the scd or white helmets counts nearly  rescue workers this claim comes only from the white helmets it could well be that the foreign office is paying for  salaries but whether those drawing
them are occupied in fulltime humanitarian work is another matter
after watching carefully the dubious video footage of rescue scenes and the far more convincing footage of white helmets participating in torture and abuse of prisoners it is difficult to see how the white
helmets are anything more than a set of expensive props and uniforms provided to extremist groups in aleppo and idlib and donned for propaganda purposes or when other uniforms are in the wash
furthermore given that the white helmets are funded by the governments and organisations who are totally unmoved by the plight of civilians in the greater part of syria the idea that these bodies would pay for humanitarian duties on the part of the white helmets seems somewhat optimistic
if the white helmets are have a dualpurpose function it is not propagandisthumanitarian but propagandistterrorist
i would also take issue with the statement the sad thing is that avaaz has learned nothing from its own campaign for a nofly zone in libya this view like the idea that the us etc keep making mistakes is following a mistaken policy presupposes that avaaz is wellintentioned that it opposes the destruction of iraq libya syria iran russia"";0"

"729;analyst most americans like neither candidate;""feds warn nyc officials about possible al qaeda attack  
new york post 
new york city law enforcement authorities are on high alert after receiving a warning by the feds about a possible attack by al qaeda on the eve of election day sources said 
us intelligence officials alerted joint terrorism task forces of the threat which also included texas and virginia  though specific sites targeted for monday in the three states were not mentioned a federal source told the post 
mayor bill de blasio said friday he had learned of the threat several days ago during classified briefings 
we are still very much assessing the credibility it is not at all clear how credible this is de blasio told wnycs brian lehrer on his weekly radio show were certainly in a vigilant position 
hizzoner said the nypd is planning an extraordinary police presence for tuesday when americans go to the polls 
for the first time in memory there will be two presidential campaigns having their victory celebrations in new york city on tuesday night he said quickly correcting himself that only one candidate will be celebrating 
donald trump the republican nominee will be at the new york hilton midtown on sixth avenue while hillary clinton his democratic counterpart will be at the javits convention center across town on th avenue 
police also will be heavily deployed for the new york city marathon on sunday de blasio said 
meanwhile gov andrew cuomo declined to confirm the threat friday but also noted the high state of alert for election day 
we have more state police more national guard more soldiers on duty than ever before he said so the bad news is new york is often a threat the good news is weve been dealing with this now for over a decade and we have prepared for it 
the nypd and the port authority of new york and new jersey said they had been alerted to the possible attacks 
we are aware of the information we have been working with the fbi through the joint terrorism task force and our counterterrorism and intelligence bureaus the nypd said in a statement 
we continue to encourage anyone with any information that could be relevant to the safety of our city to contact law enforcement the department said 
the port authority  which operates airports tunnels and bridges in and around the big apple  said it too was prepared 
we are continuing the high level of security we have had in place at all of our facilities for many months spokesman steve coleman told the post 
the fbi did not comment specifically about the threat against the three states but said counterterrorism and homeland security authorities remain vigilant and wellpostured to handle attacks 
the fbi working with our federal state and local counterparts shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety an fbi official said 
fridays threat followed a report by nbc news that the us government believes hackers from russia or other countries may try to unleash cyberattacks to wreak havoc ahead of election day 
an effort coordinated by the white house and the department of homeland security  and including the cia the national security agency and other elements of the department of defense  is being conducted to avert attacks nbc news reported"";0"

"740;project veritas ive known the president since he was a community organizer in chicago;""realism about the jihad threat in oklahoma oklahoma state rep john bennett ventures where few dare to tread october   robert spencer 
in an age of nearuniversal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots nature and magnitude of the jihad threat it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly state representative john bennett of oklahoma a marine and combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan  is one of an alltoorare breed 
on tuesday bennett held an interim study on the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america in his request to hold this study he explained this will be a study of the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america 
this kind of study should have been held not just in the oklahoma house of representatives but in the us house and senate as well that such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix were in and the situation is only marginally better in oklahoma nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what were up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and islamic supremacism 
and so it was in tulsa on tuesday the interim study featured testimony by former fbi agent john guandolo and chris gaubatz whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair are chronicled in the eyeopening book muslim mafia  
gaubatz and guandolo presented evidence including land records showing that the islamic society of greater oklahoma city isgoc is owned by the muslim brotherhood group the north american islamic trust nait that both cair which has an active chapter in oklahoma city and isgoc are muslim brotherhood organizations and that cair has extensive ties to the jihad terror group hamas which styles itself the muslim brotherhood for palestine they pointed out that since imad enchassi the imam of isgoc is a palestinian and has all these ties to the muslim brotherhood he likely also has links to hamas 
guandolo and gaubatz did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay they laid out fbi evidence muslim brotherhood documents and more demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence 
predictably however the mainstream media which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the left and the democratic party  focused entirely on the presence of adam soltani of cairok and enchassi the tulsa world ran a piece with the hysterical headline state representative brands cairok its director and a local imam as terrorists it quoted soltani raging against bennett rep bennett is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda this hearing was a new low for rep bennett as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the oklahoma muslim community 
the world magisterially told its readers that cair is a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of islam it didnt see fit to mention that cair is an unindicted coconspirator in a hamas terror funding case  so named by the justice department there was not a word in the world report about how cair officials have repeatedly refused to denounce hamas and hizballah as terrorist groups several former cair officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror  cairs cofounder and longtime board chairman omar ahmad as well as its chief spokesman ibrahim hooper have made islamic supremacist statements  ahmad denies this but the original reporter stands by her story  a california chapter distributed a poster telling muslims not to talk to the fbi and a florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message  cair has opposed virtually every antiterror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the united arab emirates 
but the tulsa world and other mainstream media outlets that covered bennetts study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that instead predictably enough they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in racebaiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection 
john bennett and the people of oklahoma deserve better there are legitimate questions about cair and isgoc bennett dared to raise them tuesday for that he is being subjected to a media lynching that is cynically designed to obscure the genuine concerns he raised  yet ever since a member of isgoc beheaded a coworker in  these concerns are more urgent than ever 
the media enablers of jihad must be decisively repudiated please email the speaker of the oklahoma house jeff w hickman politely and courteously expressing your support for john bennett and requesting that his hearing be just the first of a series his email is email protected and his phone number is   
john bennett has yet again stuck his neck out for freedom in these hard times those who are willing to do that have to hang together"";1"

Embattled San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi convincingly lost his bid for re-election Tuesday after spending months in the national spotlight as the face of his city s controversial  sanctuary city  policy on illegal immigration. The murder of Kate Steinle brought to the forefront the sanctuary city policy in San Francisco. The refusal to acknowledge the illegality of this policy and the treatment of the Steinle family couldn t be more shameful. Our hope is that this landslide sends a message to those who have been ignoring the rule of law. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Steinle Family who ve suffered so much.Mirkarimi

"866;comment on brilliant takedown of feminism from an old man by how to kill zombie arguments;""submit home this month popular  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby photography really is one of the most rewarding hobbies a man could pursue ness nomadison 
ness is a thirtysomething american with almost a decade of experience living and traveling across asia hes a strong believer in pursuing ones passions continual selfimprovement and just being the best man he can be he runs his own website nessthenomadcom  november   lifestyle 
have you ever had a curiosity in photography yet you werent sure if its a hobby really worthy of your limited time then this article was written for you as i was also once in your shoes 
i picked up a dslr camera for the first time back in  which awoke a passion inside me that i never even knew was there three and half years later im here to tell you just a few of the many benefits and realizations ive experienced by taking on this timeless hobby here are eight reasons photography might just be the most meaningful hobby youve overlooked your entire life  an opportunity to flex your creative muscle 
in order to be balanced human beings i believe people need to be physically healthy spiritually awake and creatively expressive photography just like writing and film is a selfless way to be creative while also giving something back to the world 
the way we interpret our world changes from individual to individual and photography provides a medium for people to express themselves ask ten different photographers to photograph the same thing  a city for example  and be prepared to see ten wildly different visions of the same subject in our sensoryoverload world it feels good to create something thats uniquely you  appreciate and understand your surroundings more 
i now find myself seeing everything around me in rectangular framesa takeaway from having to frame so many pictures over the years oh those people over there would fit perfectly into a  box or that building over there would look perfect boxed in from this angle my eyes are now sharper than ever 
but i also find myself observing and appreciating all the little things around me i always have to keep my camera nearby because i often want to photograph something ive noticed in my daily routine the pattern on a sewer lid a reflection in a puddle birds perched in a tree and so forth 
my prephotographer self just like most of the rest of the world would have walked right past these things without a care in the world yet now i can be entertained from the most minuscule and simple things especially if my camera is handy the world is full of photogenic things if can just teach yourself to notice them  help preserve history 
since its inception photography has always been one of the most moving ways to preserve history in our rapidly changing modern times photos touch people in a way other media cant both photography and video are both visual arts but photographs differ in that they capture merely one frame of what is going on yet one frame is all one needs to feel taken back to another time 
with the advent of the smartphone photography is as accessible as ever while this sounds good on paper the truth is our worlds becoming more and more flooded with garbage and narcissistic photographs our world needs more adventurous and welltrained photographers out there taking photos of the modern world we live in and the rapid changes its undergoing these are the photos that will be cherished decades down the road not all the shitty selfies that bog down social media  travel experiences will be more meaningful 
photography goes with traveling like bread goes with butter it took me nearly five years of traveling internationally to finally get serious about doing photography on my trips and after i got started i never looked back 
rather than traveling for escapism and hedonism im traveling to learn about and document our world as a result my trips feel much more meaningful and fulfilling than they ever did before the way you see and come to understand a country as a photographer is quite different than if you werent one 
i now divide my history of travel experiences into two separate groupsthe trips i had before i owned a dslr camera and the trips i had after buying one photography is so fun and addicting that i find myself wanting to go back to all those predslr camera destinations even the ones i didnt enjoy all that much just so i can reexperience them with a camera in hand  an opportunity to meet new people 
one thing i always try to do when i travel is meet fellow photographers whether they be foreign or local i appreciate talking to people with an observational eye as they can provide me with unique insight that nonphotographers rarely can 
but photography doesnt just help you meet other photographers it helps you meet other people from all walks of life ive had regular people on the street come up and talk to me once they saw i was taking photos ive also met people from online for no other reason than they liked my work 
being a good photographer can also be a great way to meet women theyre not gonna start blowing you as soon as they see your awesome pictures but dont be surprised if you discover some newfound female admiration once your excellent photography skills are out in the open and if you can make a woman look beautiful in a photo shell admire you in a way you never imagined  a blog with an edge 
in the diverse world of independently run blogs how many bloggers do you know who can both write well and photograph well i can literally only think of one  and the fact that this blogger is just as good at utilizing a camera as he is at wielding a pen or rather a keyboard puts his website in a league of its own in terms of quality content 
though i still highly respect the good bloggers out there for their amazing writing skills and insights i think theyre doing both their readers and websites a great disservice by merely using stock photos or shitty shotwithacellphone photos in their articles 
readers can definitely tell the difference when a blogger takes all of their own photos with a nice dslr camera start taking nice dslrshot photos and see for yourself how they can enhance your articles theyll give you just that much more of an edge over all the other bloggers who dont  youll also have an edge over  of others on social media and dating sites 
since everyone else is posting lame smartphonetaken shots all over their social media accounts your dslrshot photos could shine like diamonds in the rough the same way you stand above  of other men by lifting weights regularly the same advantage can be expected by not taking cheap shortcuts with your social mediabound photography your facebook instagram and twitter accounts will all look better than ever before 
this is also true for dating websites and apps where most chumps just take some lame mirror selfies with their smartphone and then upload them to their accounts dudes with welltaken nontraditional photos stand out big time dont just take my word for it as there has actually been plenty of discussion about these benefits over at the roosh v forum  
and although they can be very helpful you dont actually need another photographer with you to get some good shots of yourself rather all you need is your camera an autofocus lens a tripod a remote shutter and a creative eye  a resumeenhancing marketable skill 
photography isnt just mentally rewarding it can also be financially rewarding if you play your cards right the field of profitable photography may be vast and highly competitive but one things for sure  the demand for new photographs is infinite the world never stops turning after all stock portrait wedding wildlife travel sports and news photography are just a few of the most in demand and profitable niches 
but if you really wanna make money selling your photographs you gotta make a name for yourself by sharpening your skills and networking with the right people a great photographer who no one knows exists wont make any money 
my father is an outdoorsman slash wildlife photographer with decades of experience tens of thousands of photos and a giant network of contacts from his industry it seems like magazine and website editors are always knocking on his door because they know he probably has a nice shot of exactly what theyre looking for often all he has to do is dig through his archives and boomhes made  bucks conclusion 
stop dreaming about it and just give photography a shot already borrow your friend or a family members dslr camera for the weekend and just get out there and take pictures of anything that strikes your fancy 
photography takes decades to master but it all begins with a single click of the shutter button yet sometimes all it takes is one little click to realize youve been missing out on something very big and meaningful your entire life youll never know until you try"";1"

queen elizabeth ii is not like you and me 
did you know she is immune from prosecution that she has her own personal poet paid in sherry wine or that she holds dominion over british swans and can fire the entire australian government 
its true that her role as the british head of state is largely ceremonial and the monarch no longer holds any serious power from day to day the historic prerogative powers of the sovereign have been devolved largely to government ministers but this still means that when the british government declares war or regulates the civil service or signs a treaty it is doing so only on her authority 
and she still wields some of these prerogative powers herself  as well as numerous other unique powers ranging from the surprising to the utterly bizarre 
most famously she owns all swans in the river thames 
technically all unmarked swans in open water belong to the queen though the crown exercises her ownership only on certain stretches of the thames and its surrounding tributaries according to the official website of the royal family 
today this tradition is observed during the annual swan upping in which swans in the river thames are caught ringed and set free again as part of census of the swan population 
its a highly ceremonial affair taking place over five days swan uppers wear traditional uniforms and row upriver in six skiffs accompanied by the queens swan marker 
the swans are also given a health check and ringed with individual identification numbers by the queens swan warden a professor of ornithology at the university of oxfords department of zoology according to the royal family website 
rule britannia britannia rules the waves goes a classic british song  and this rule extends beneath the waves too the sovereign has dominion over a variety of aquatic animals in british waters 
the queen still technically owns all the sturgeons whales and dolphins in the waters around england and wales in a rule that dates back to a statute from  during the reign of king edward ii according to time 
according to the article this statute is still valid today and sturgeons porpoises whales and dolphins are recognised as fishes royal when they are captured within  miles about  km of uk shores or wash ashore they may be claimed on behalf of the crown generally when brought into port a sturgeon is sold in the usual way and the purchaser as a gesture of loyalty requests the honour of its being accepted by elizabeth 
the law is still observed in  a welsh fisherman was investigated by the police after catching a foot sturgeon the bbc reported at the time the scottish government also issued guidance on the law in  writing that the right to claim royal fish in scotland allows the scottish government on behalf of the crown to claim stranded whales which are too large to be drawn to land by a wain pulled by six oxen 
the queen can drive without a licence 
driving licenses are issued in the queens name yet she is the only person in the united kingdom who doesnt legally need a license to drive or a number plate on her cars according to time 
despite not being required to have a license the queen is comfortable behind the wheel having learned to drive during world war ii when she operated a firstaid truck for the womens auxillary territorial service as a result of the queens training she can also change a spark plug time notes 
queen elizabeth ii isnt afraid to show off her driving skills either in  she surprised king abdullah of saudi arabia then still a prince by driving him around in her country seat of balmoral 
former british ambassador sherard cowpercoles recounted the meeting in the sunday times as instructed the crown prince climbed into the front seat of the front land rover with his interpreter in the seat behind to his surprise the queen climbed into the driving seat turned the ignition and drove off women are not  yet  allowed to drive in saudi arabia and abdullah was not used to being driven by a woman let alone a queen 
cowpercoles continued his nervousness only increased as the queen an army driver in wartime accelerated the land rover along the narrow scottish estate roads talking all the time through his interpreter the crown prince implored the queen to slow down and concentrate on the road ahead 
unlike other members of the royal family the queen does not require a passport as they are issued in her name despite this lack of travel documents she has been abroad many times 
she has two birthdays 
when youre the british head of state one birthday just isnt enough the queens official birthday is celebrated on a saturday in june though her actual birthday is on april  
official celebrations to mark a sovereigns birthday have often been held on a day other than the actual birthday particularly when the actual birthday has not been in the summer according to the royal mint 
both birthdays are celebrated in suitable style too her actual birthday is marked publicly by gun salutes in central london at midday according to the official website of the british monarchy this includes a gun salute in hyde park a gun salute in windsor great park and a gun salute at the tower of london in  her majesty celebrated her th birthday in  with a walkabout in the streets outside of windsor castle to meet wellwishers 
for her official birthday celebrations meanwhile she is joined by other members of the royal family at the spectacular trooping the colour parade which moves between buckingham palace the mall and horseguards parade 
she has her own private cash machine 
less a power and more a perk of the job a private cash machine for use by the royal family is installed in the basement of buckingham palace its provided by coutts one of britains most prestigious  and exclusive  banks 
the queen has her own personal poet 
the poet laureate is an honorary position in british society appointed by the monarch to a poet whose work is of national significance according to the official website of the british monarchy when first the role was introduced the appointee was paid  per year plus a butt of canary wine today the poet laureate is given a barrel of sherry 
carol ann duffy will hold the position until  
she has to sign laws 
the queens consent is necessary to turn any bill into an actual law once a proposed law has passed both houses of parliament it makes its way to the palace for approval which is called royal assent the most recent british monarch to refuse to provide royal assent was queen anne back in  
royal assent is different than queens consent in which the queen must consent to any law being debated in parliament that affects the monarchys interests such as reforming the prerogative or tax laws that might affect the duchy of cornwall for example without consent the bill cannot be debated in parliament 
queens consent is exercised only on the advice of ministers but its existence provides the government with a tool for blocking debate on certain subjects if bills are tabled by backbench rebels or the opposition 
it has been exercised at least  times according to documents released under the freedom of information act including one instance in which the queen completely vetoed the military actions against iraq bill in  a private members bill that sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against iraq from the monarch to parliament the guardian reported in  
she can create lords 
the queen has the power to appoint lords who can then sit in parliament the upper house in britains legislative system like many other powers this is exercised only on the advice of elected government ministers 
she doesnt have to pay tax but she does anyway 
the queen does not have to pay tax but she has been voluntarily paying income tax and capital gains tax since  
the queen has the power to form governments 
unlike the queen prime minister david cameron doesnt literally sit on a throne rob stothardgetty imageshbobi 
the queen previously wielded the power to dissolve parliament and call a general election but the fixedterm parliaments act put an end to that in  now a twothirds vote in the commons is required to dissolve parliament before a fiveyear fixedterm is up 
she does still play a part after an election however when she calls on the mp most able to form a government to do so 
this caused some worry ahead of this years general election it once looked as if the conservatives might not have a majority but would be the largest party and would try to form a government meanwhile it was feasible that labour could form a majority despite having fewer seats by entering into a coalition with multiple other parties 
in this situation the queen would have been stuck between a rock and a hard place every year she opens parliament with the queens speech which lays out the governments plans but to give david camerons speech would arguably be to tacitly endorse his government  while staying away would send the opposite message 
at one point the times was told by sources that she planned to stay away if cameron failed to secure enough mps but the palace later had an aboutface royal sources confirmed she would lead proceedings even if there was a risk the speech would be overthrown the following week because the tories had failed to muster enough backing from smaller parties the times subsequently reported 
she has knights 
sure they no longer ride around on horseback wooing maidens with their tales of valour but britain still retains knights like lords they are appointed by the queen  and she knights them personally 
knighthoods are typically given to figures who have made a particular contribution to british society  whether in business the arts the military or elsewhere after terry pratchett was knighted the legendary fantasy author forged himself a special sword using pieces of a meteorite 
the individuals knighted are decided by ministers the bbc reports who present her with a list of nominees each year for her approval 
she is exempt from freedom of information requests 
all information about the royal family is exempt from freedom of information requests the exemption was made after a legal battle between the guardian and the government to have letters from prince charles sent to whitehall ministers made public the socalled black spider memos were recently released but the change means the same cant happen in the future 
she can ignore or overrule ministerial advice in grave constitutional crisis 
while the overwhelming majority of the queens prerogative powers are devolved to her ministers there is one exception that allows her to wield power herself only in grave constitutional crisis the sovereign can act contrary to or without ministerial advice with no precedent in modern times its not clear what would actually constitute this but the possibility remains 
the queen holds the ability to fire the entire australian government 
as the head of state in australia the queen has certain powers over the government in  for example the queens representative in the country at the time gov gen sir john kerr fired the prime minister in response to a government shutdown 
kerr appointed a replacement who immediately passed the spending bill to fund the government max fisher wrote in the washington post three hours later kerr dismissed the rest of parliament then australia held elections to restart from scratch and they havent had another shutdown since 
in addition to the uk and australia the queen is also the head of state in antigua and barbuda the bahamas barbados belize canada grenada jamaica new zealand papua new guinea saint kitts and nevis saint lucia saint vincent and the grenadines solomon islands and tuvalu 
all the above are commonwealth realms or former british colonies the british sovereign retains the position she holds in the united kingdom that of head of state as in britain this is largely a ceremonial role from day to day 
shes the head of a religion 
queen elizabeth ii is the head of the church of england britains state religion first established after king henry viii split away from the catholic church in rome in the th century 
her formal title is defender of the faith and supreme governor of the church of england and she also has the power to appoint bishops and archbishops as with many of her other powers however this is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister who himself takes advice from a church commission 
an interesting side effect of this is that the sovereign must be a confirmed member of church of england catholics and those of other religions may not ascend to the british throne if prince charles converted to islam for example he would be unable to become king after queen elizabeth ii dies 
she gets to give away special money to the elderly 
maundy money is a special kind of silver coin the queen gives away to pensioners every year at a uk cathedral every easter in a special ceremony the number of recipients corresponds with the sovereigns age this year for example she will be  when easter rolls around so she will give maundy money away to  pensioners 
the coins are technically legal tender despite coming in unconventional pence and pence denominations but given the coins rare status they tend not to enter general circulation 
shes also immune from prosecution 
all prosecutions are carried out in the name of the sovereign and she is both immune from prosecution and cannot be compelled to give evidence in court 
in theory the sovereign is incapable of thinking or doing wrong legal scholar john kirkhope told business insider however barrister baroness helena kennedy qc told the bbc in  that nowadays that immunity is questionable 
although civil and criminal proceedings cannot be taken against the sovereign as a person under uk law the queen is careful to ensure that all her activities in her personal capacity are carried out in strict accordance with the law according to official site of the monarchy 
if the monarch did commit a grievance offence he or she would almost certainly be forced to abdicate there is at least one precedent of the courts prosecuting the sovereign in the th century king charles i was tried for treason following the english civil war he said no earthly power can justly call me who am your king in question as a delinquent the court disagreed and had him executed 
the queen has the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers 
assuming no grave constitutional crisis the queens input into the legislative process is supposed to be limited in real terms to the right to be consulted to encourage and to warn her ministers  advice delivered via meetings with the prime minister 
the queen also has certain historic rights and privileges john kirkhope a lawyer who successfully campaigned to have details of queens consent made public provided business insider with a list of some of the stranger rights the queen still holds 
hungerford has to present a red rose to the sovereign in exchange for its fishing and grazing rightsthe duke of atholl must pay by way of a rose whenever the sovereign calls this most recently happened during the reign of queen victoria so its unclear whether the rose has to be any particular colourif the sovereign passes near kidwelly castle in wales the tenant has to provide a bodyguard in full armour this is complicated slightly by the fact the castle is a ruinthe marquis of ailesbury owns savernake forest and is required to produce a blast on a hunting horn should the sovereign pass through the forest this last happened in similarly the owner of dunlambert castle in northern ireland has to produce a blast on an ancient bugleand lastly many landowners must also pay a quitrent  a kind of tax on their property paid to the monarch some are pretty unusual 
the owner of sauchlemuir castle must set out three glasses of port on new years eve for the grandmother of james iv of scotland for reference james iv served from  to the owner of fowlis must deliver  when required  a snowball in midsummerthe city of gloucester pays for its holdings of crown lands by providing an enormous eel piegreat yarmouth must provide a hundred herrings baked in  pasties to the sheriff who then sends them to the lord of the manor  who then sends them to the sovereignthe duke of marlborough has to present a small satin flag with a fleur de lys on august  the anniversary of the battle of blenheimthe duke of wellington has to present a french tricolour flag before noon on june   the anniversary of the battle of waterloo"";0"
